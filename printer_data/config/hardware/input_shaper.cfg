result_folder: ~/printer_data/config/ShakeTune_results
#    The folder where the results will be stored. It will be created if it doesn't exist.

#    The number of results to keep in the result_folder. The oldest results will
#    be automatically deleted after each runs.
keep_raw_csv: False
#    If True, the raw CSV files will be kept in the result_folder alongside the
#    PNG graphs. If False, they will be deleted and only the graphs will be kept.
show_macros_in_webui: True
#    Mainsail and Fluidd doesn't create buttons for "system" macros that are not in the
#    printer.cfg file. If you want to see the macros in the webui, set this to True.
timeout: 300
#    The maximum time in seconds to let Shake&Tune process the CSV files and generate the graphs.
